# tutorials

This is the repository that stores the content of the website for `/tutorials`.

The text of the tutorials are HTML files in `tutorials/`.

The codes are managed externally and are copied to this repository
from `bridges-client-testing`. So DO NOT EDIT the codes of the
tutorials. Rather fix the codes in `bridges-client-testing` and then
regenerate the codes in here by running the script
`tutorials/testing/scripts/copy_code.sh`.
